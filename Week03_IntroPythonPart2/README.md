## Questions from last class:
 1. How do I change a commit message?
 
    - GitHub provides nice instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/changing-a-commit-message).
     Please do not amend older or multiple commit messages as this could cause issues in class with pair programming that we will not have time to resolve during class.
     
2. On IntroPython1.ipynb we open the coding file from the command line and then we did nothing. Did I miss something?
    - We used `code .` in the terminal to open vscode with current directory open, and then we switched to using vscode. If we misinterpreted this question please find us at office hours.
