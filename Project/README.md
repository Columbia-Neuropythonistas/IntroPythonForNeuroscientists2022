## Project Outline
Can work individually or in pairs.
- If you want help finding a partner let us know if there  are particular datasets you are most excited about.

Four class periods (not expected to work outside class)
- Class 1/2: working on projects
- Class 3: code exchange
- Class 4: presentations (5 minutes)

Goal: work with data in python
- This can be your own, or a supplied dataset
- Try out a tool or package that you are interested in
- Create a small notebook showing all of your work and explaining it so that someone else can run and understand it

## Dataset & Tools Resources
Feel free to bring your own data. If you bring your own data, make sure to have it in a format that can be loaded into python by the first project work day.
