# Week 2 -- Intro to Python Part 1

## Pre-Work IN PROGRESS DO NOT FOLLOW YET
Like last week, if you run into issues please contact us before class. Please upload a screenshot of the problem you are running into to the relevant assignment on courseworks so we can help you debug.

### 1. Test to make sure you have your ssh key set up correctly by following the [test instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection).
- Please take a screenshot of your terminal output showing what is expected from step 3 of the instructions and submit it to the assignment on courseworks.
- Remember that you should copy lines starting with `$` in to your terminal, excluding the `$`. Lines after `#` give a comment or explanation on what you are being told to do, and lines after `>` are the output you should expect to see.
- Windows users, use git bash within PowerShell for this.
- If you get errors about git being an unknown command, make sure the intropython environment is active for this step.
- If you run into issues, make sure you have finished following the [ssh key setup instructions we used in the first class, specifically: 
  1. [Generating a new ssh key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key)
  2. [Adding your ssh key to the ssh agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent)
  3. [Add a new ssh key to your github account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account#adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-account)
  
### 2. Navigate to your git repo
- If you were able to `git clone` successfully during or after class, use `cd` and `ls` in terminal to navigate to your github repository on your computer.
- If you were unable to run `git clone` successfully during or after class, please do so now.
